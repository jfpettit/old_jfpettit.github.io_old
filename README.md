View the website [here](https://jfpettit.github.io). 

This is my website. It is very simple in structure and contains pages for a homepage and projects page. There is code from [p5.js](https://p5js.org) to make a cool flocking animation across the screen and a js script to do a colorful random walk around the screen. Right now, my site uses the random walk on the homepage only. I'm not planning to add p5js sketches to the projects page. Theoretially, any p5js sketch should work as the background for the homepage, since the rest of the layout should be agnostic to the sketch. The flocking animation is from the p5js examples page. Feel free to fork it if you like it and want to use it yourself.
