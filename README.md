This is my website. It is very simple in structure and contains pages for a homepage and projects page. There is code from [p5.js](https://p5js.org) to make a cool flocking animation across the screen, however, it is not currently used. Most of the javascript code I actually borrowed from their examples page. Feel free to fork it if you like it and want to use it yourself.

The Blog and GitHub links in the navigation bar link to external pages where my blog is hosted on [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com) and to my GitHub account.
