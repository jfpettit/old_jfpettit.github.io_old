This is my website landing page. It is very simple in structure and is a single
page site. It uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org) to make a cool flocking animation
across the screen. Most of the javascript code I actually borrowed from their
examples page. Feel free to fork it if you like it and want to use it yourself.

The Blog and GitHub links in the navigation bar link to external pages where
my blog is hosted on [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com) and to my GitHub account.

**This website doesn't yet format properly on mobile devices, I'm working on fixing it.**
