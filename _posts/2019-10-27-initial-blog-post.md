Until recently, I've been using [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com) to host my blog. Overall, I really like Svbtle and have enjoyed using their service. However, it is lacking [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) support. Since I want to blog about machine learning, probability, and math, it's important to me to be able to use LaTeX.

LaTeX is a mathematical typesetting language, meaning that it can be used to write math equations like this one:

$$f(x) = x^2$$

But of course, the file this post is written in isn't a pure LaTeX file, but is instead a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file that is converted to HTML when it's loaded onto the website. Combining Markdown with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) allows the user to write equations on their own line, as seen above, or in-line, like this: $$f(x) = x^2$$.

Luckily, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is compatible with all of these things. Actually, the default GitHub Pages sites are built using a service called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which makes building your own website quite painless and allows you to use Markdown and MathJax in blogging.

For now, I'll continue to keep my Svbtle account since writing on their platform is a very pleasant experience, and I'll write more mathematically-focused posts on my website here.
