# About me

My name is Jacob Pettit, I did my B.S. in [Scientific Computing](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/) at Florida State University. I'm currently working on machine learning research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Long term, I'd like to try to understand cognition and develop intelligent machines. I'm also interested in meta-learning, knowledge representation, and reinforcement learning (RL).

In my free time, I love to surf, rock climb, and enjoy long hikes with my girlfriend and my dog. Feel free to explore my website, and you can contact me at either my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacobpettit18) or [email](mailto:jfpettit@gmail.com). :)
